<h1><center>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</center></h1>

Progressive enhancement is a web design strategy that puts emphasis on web content first and foremost, loading a page’s text through HTML source code rather than having to wait for JavaScript to initiate and load the content – a process that modern parlance has nicknamed “graceful degradation”. This enables a web page to load faster, and also renders it backward compatible for users with slower connections. Users with faster connections still get better loading times, but this “one size fits all” approach still ultimately enables all users to view web content, whereas one JavaScript error would render a site unreadable. <p>
Graceful degradation focused on building websites for the most advanced, capable browsers. The emphasis was on content, and there was very much an Excelsior (forever forward) mindset to it, as the early niche market of tech-literate users were expected to keep their equipment up to date. However, this philosophy clashed violently with the vision of a universally accessible web championed by the creator of HTML itself: 
<blockquote>“For anyone to be able to publish anything on the web, all the computers involved have to speak the same languages to each other, no matter what different hardware people are using; where they live; or what cultural and political beliefs they have. In this way, the web breaks down silos while still allowing diversity to flourish.”</blockquote>

Progressive Enhancement is based on six core principles:<p>
  <li>Basic content should be accessible to all web browsers.</li>
  <li>Basic functionality should be accessible to all web browsers.</li>
  <li>Sparse, semantic markup contains all content.</li>
  <li>Enhanced layout is provided by externally linked CSS.</li>
  <li>Enhanced behavior is provided by externally linked JavaScript.</li>
  <li>End-user web browser preferences are respected.</li><p>

There’s an old saw about a picture being worth a thousand words. Following on this logic, an enterprising programmer, using Abraham Maslow’s Pyramid of Hierarchal Needs as a guide, created a pyramid for Progressive Enhancement, which I am including to sum up this article:<p>
